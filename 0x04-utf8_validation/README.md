# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation Project

In the "0x04. UTF-8 Validation" project, you'll apply your knowledge of bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Concepts Needed

### Bitwise Operations in Python

- Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python:
  - AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), shifts (`<<`, `>>`).
- [Python Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme

- Familiarity with UTF-8 encoding rules:
  - How characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
  - Patterns representing valid UTF-8 encoded characters.
- [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)
- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)

### Data Representation

- Working with data at the byte level.
- Handling least significant bits (LSB) of integers for byte data simulation.

### List Manipulation in Python

- Iterating through lists, accessing elements, and using list comprehensions.
- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Boolean Logic

- Applying logical operations for decision-making.
- Using boolean logic within the program.

## Resources

- By studying these concepts and using the provided resources, you'll be well-prepared to tackle the UTF-8 validation project. It involves applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
