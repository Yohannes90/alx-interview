# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Overview

The "Island Perimeter" project challenges you to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and logical reasoning to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The task is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid represented by a 2D array of integers. This project involves navigating and analyzing 2D arrays and applying logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation.

## Concepts Needed

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- **Accessing and Iterating**: Learn how to access and iterate over elements in a 2D array.
- **Navigation**: Understand how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

### Conditional Logic
- **Perimeter Contribution**: Apply conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the island’s perimeter.

### Counting Techniques
- **Edge Counting**: Develop a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Task Breakdown**: Break down the problem into smaller tasks such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

### Python Programming
- **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements**: Apply conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
