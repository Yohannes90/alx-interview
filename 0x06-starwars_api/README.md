# 0x06. Star Wars API

## Project Overview

The "Star Wars Characters" project requires you to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument. This project will help you practice web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Concepts Needed

### HTTP Requests in JavaScript
- **Understanding how to make HTTP requests to external services using the `axios` module or alternatives like `fetch` in Node.js.**
  - [A Complete Guide to Making HTTP Requests in Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/making-http-requests-with-nodejs)

### Working with APIs
- **Understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them.**
- **Parsing JSON data returned by APIs.**
  - [Working with APIs in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction)

### Asynchronous Programming
- **Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and `async/await` syntax.**
- **Handling API response data asynchronously.**
  - [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)

### Command Line Arguments in Node.js
- **Using the `process.argv` array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.**
  - [How to Parse Command Line Arguments in Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/nodejs-command-line-arguments)

### Array Manipulation and Iteration
- **Iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures to format and display character names.**
  - [JavaScript Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- `request` module installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-wars-characters.git
    cd star-wars-characters
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install request
    ```

### Usage

To fetch and display Star Wars characters from a specified movie, run the script with the movie ID as a command-line argument:

```sh
node star_wars_characters.js <movie_id>
```

## Additional Resources

- [Mock Technical Interview](https://www.interviewcake.com/mock-interview)

By familiarizing yourself with these concepts and resources, you will be able to efficiently retrieve, process, and display Star Wars characters from the specified movie using the Star Wars API, demonstrating your ability to work with external APIs and manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.
