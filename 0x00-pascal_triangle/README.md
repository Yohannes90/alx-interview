# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle
## What is Pascal's Triangle?
- A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row. This concept is used widely in probability, combinatorics, and algebra.

           1   1
         1   2   1
       1   3   3   1
     1   4   6   4   1
- In short, Pascal's Triangle is a triangular pattern of numbers where each number is the sum of the two above it.
