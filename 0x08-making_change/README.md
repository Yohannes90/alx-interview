# 0x08. Making Change

Welcome to the "Change comes from within" project! In this project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient.

## Key Concepts and Resources

### Concepts Needed

#### Greedy Algorithms
- **Understanding Greedy Algorithms**: Learn how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.

- **Basic Principles**: Understand the basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
- **Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure**: Learn about these concepts in the context of the coin change problem.

#### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Time and Space Complexity**: Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- **Efficiency**: Strive for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

#### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Breaking Down Problems**: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- **Iterative vs Recursive Approaches**: Explore both iterative and recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

#### Python Programming
- **List Manipulation and Comprehensions**: Manipulate lists and use list comprehensions.
- **Efficient Functions**: Implement functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
